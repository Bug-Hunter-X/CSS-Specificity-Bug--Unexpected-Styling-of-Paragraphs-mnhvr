The solution involves using the `!important` flag or reorganizing the selectors to change specificity. The solution using `!important` is shown below.  While functional, it's generally better practice to avoid `!important` and restructure selectors. In this example, moving the general `p` selector after the more specific one resolves the issue by ensuring the general style is applied. 

```css
p {
  color: blue;
}

.container p {
  color: red !important;
}
```

Alternative solution (preferred):

```css
.container p {
  color: red;
}

p {
  color: blue;
}
```
